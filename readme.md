## Reflections

Short reflections on what I've learned each day.

### 01 - JavaScript Drum Kit
*March 3, 2020*

Learned about key events, playing audio, and listening for the transition end event. I also learned the => shortcut for function and saw an example of cleaning up functions to be a bit more modular/reusable.
