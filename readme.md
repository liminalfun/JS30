# JavaScript30

WIP kit including the Starter Files + Completed solutions for the [JavaScript 30 Day Challenge](https://JavaScript30.com) course from Wes Bos.

## Reflections

Short reflections on what I've learned each day.

### 01 - JavaScript Drum Kit
*March 3, 2021*

Learned about key events, playing audio, and listening for the transition end event. I also learned the => shortcut for function and saw an example of cleaning up functions to be a bit more modular/reusable.

### 02 - JS and CSS Clock
*March 4, 2021*

Learned about setDate, setInterval, and ES6 template literals (backtick). I wanted to know more, so I read Stanley Ulili's article (Template Literals in Javascript Explained Like You're Twelve)[https://www.stanleyulili.com/javascript/template-literals-in-javascript-explained-like-your-twelve/].

Questions I have after this exercise are:
1. How could I write if statements to temporarily turn off the transition at 90deg so that it doesn't go all the way back?
2. How would I make each hand be a different length, but still start at the center?
3. How could I add a circle to the center, so that the line intersection point does not appear jagged?
