    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2) // when the value of age goes into age2, it does not repeat when the value age is updated

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

  
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; // updates players automatically bc team is just a reference to the original array

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();


    // one way

    //  or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); // works the same way as slice

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; // a spread will take every item out of your iterable and put it into your containing array.
    team4[3] = 'heee hawww';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'cool';
    console.log(team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // console.log(captain, person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};
    // console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.name = 'Wesley';
    console.log(dev);

    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    console.log(dev.social, wes.social);

    // will need to search online and see if I need to use a function called 'cloneDeep' -- but it's not recommended to use this bc there's usually a better way

    // "poor man's deep clone"
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); // no longer an object, it's a string, but because you JSON.parse'd it, it's immediately turned back into an object. Would need to do my own research about performance tho.
    
    console.log(dev2);
